	         On New Year’s day in 2010, I was at a competitive wood chopping event. On a table at the event there was a collection of antique axes. Dozens of axes of all shapes and sizes. Big axes and small axes. Single bladed and double. More types of axes than I knew existed.

So many variations of the same product! Why does the world need all those different axes? That’s when I realised what I was looking at.
I was looking at the design process.

Since the beginning of human history, people have been creating technology for each other. In fact, people have been making axes for over a million years. And behind each axe on that table was a conversation.

“I need an all round bushcraft axe that I can fit in this backpack.”
“I’m going to be cutting and shaping pine.”
“I want something for splitting firewood.”
The axe was made, and the customer left happy. But some of those customers came back, and they weren’t happy any more. Because something had gone wrong with their axe.

Perhaps it wasn’t strong enough. Or it was the wrong size. Or maybe they’d asked for the wrong thing in the first place. So the axe maker listened, and he made a better version. Maybe this happened a few times. But eventually the customer got the right axe, or the axe maker went out of business.

What’s significant about this process was the direct connection between the maker and the user. The feedback loop was perfect and one to one. This made it almost impossible to create the wrong thing without hearing about it later. The axe maker couldn’t get away with bad design.

The first great challenge to design
In the early parts of the 20th century, the industrial revolution caused the “natural” process of design to break down. Suddenly it was possible to put vast numbers of objects into the world and never meet the people who used them.

My microwave is a great example. Of the 9 virtually identical buttons on the control panel, I use precisely tw
